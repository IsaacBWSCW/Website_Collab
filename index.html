    <h1>Hello guys</h1>
    <p>Rooster is a very flexible meat. From Fat Parmy, to Thicc Sticks, all the way up to my personal favourite, Tender Strips of Yum. Due to this flexible nature, I felt the need to share my cock recipies.</p>
    <h100>(For legal reasons, this book, and it's contents, are a joke. We take no reponsibility for any... ruffled feathers.)</h100>
    <p>jint is good</p>
